# Zone Plate Test Image

The MATLAB function `imzoneplate` creates an image with a radially symmetric pattern with low frequencies in the middle and high frequencies near the edge. It is useful for experimenting with frequency- and direction-sensitive filtering and also for testing the anti-aliasing capability of image resizing methods.
